"""
Tests for the streaming-ASR WebSocket endpoint.

Focus: the EOF text-frame protocol (added so the React `CaptureButton` can
treat the WS `final` message as the source of truth and skip the duplicate
HTTP POST that used to run on every dictation). Ground truth: an EOF text
frame must let the server deliver `final` over the still-open socket
*without* the client having to disconnect first.

The ASR backends are mocked — we're testing protocol, not transcription
quality.
